# Miquel Fire's Advent of Code older events

Just a repo for holding my work for Older Advent of Code Events. Each folder is a year of Advent of Code, 2019 being the latest I'll do here.

Note: I had done 2019 already, but the code must have been in a Mercurial repo on Bitbucket as I hadn't switched to Git yet that year. Redoing 2019 was mainly because I wanted to do the Intcode VM a little better.

Each folder will have the event I redid, or redoing

I used a template from [Replit](https://aoc-templates.util.repl.co/) for the base code so I can run each day's parts easily.

If you're using this, just edit the run command in `index.js` file to use the day you want, then create the input file. Make sure you zero pad the filenames for the first 9 days, so day `3` would have the files `03.txt` and `03.js`.

Due to the rules of the Advent of Code site, there will be no input files in this repo.
